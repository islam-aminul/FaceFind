## Test Coverage Goals

- ‚úÖ Unit Tests: Files created, tests written
- ‚úÖ Integration Tests: Scenarios defined
- ‚úÖ E2E Tests: Workflows documented
- ‚úÖ Performance Tests: Metrics defined
- ‚úÖ Security Tests: Checklist complete
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Execution: Blocked on npm permissions

---

## Notes

- All test infrastructure is in place
- All test files are created
- All test scenarios are documented
- Only blocker is npm permission issue
- Once resolved, all tests can run
- Estimated time to complete all tests: 2-3 hours

---

**Next Step**: User needs to run `sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm` to fix permissions, then proceed with testing phases.
